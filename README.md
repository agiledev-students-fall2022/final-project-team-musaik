# MUSAIK

### Vision
The Musaik team has a vision of making connection through music a much easier process. We want our users to view our app as a hub for finding and connecting with others that share the same musical taste. 

### Description
New music discovery is a souless, intensive experience. If you want to find new artists, you'll have to sift through playlist on top of playlist for hours. Musaik will connect users through streaming parties and auto-match chats. Users will discover new music easily and enjoyably.
